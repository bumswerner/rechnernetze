The following problems have been reported by readers building the source
code. I am just collecting these and making them available: I do not
have access to all the systems to try and duplicate the problems and/or
fix them. Please let me know of any additional problems.

    * FreeBSD 2.2.5. The configure script does not detect the timespec
      structure that is defined in <sys/time.h>. The fix is to add
      #define HAVE_TIMESPEC_STRUCT 1 to config.h.

      An alternate fix is to change the configure script, as noted here:

echo $ac_n "checking for timespec{}""... $ac_c" 1>&6
echo "configure:3077: checking for timespec{}" >&5
if eval "test \"`echo '$''{'ac_cv_have_timespec_struct'+set}'`\" = set";
then
  echo $ac_n "(cached) $ac_c" 1>&6
else
  cat > conftest.$ac_ext <<EOF
#line 3082 "configure"
#include "confdefs.h"
#include <time.h>
#include <sys/time.h>   /* <== added for FreeBSD 2.2.5 */
EOF
if (eval "$ac_cpp conftest.$ac_ext") 2>&5 |
  egrep "timespec" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  rm -rf conftest*
  ac_cv_have_timespec_struct=yes
else
  rm -rf conftest*
  ac_cv_have_timespec_struct=no
fi
rm -f conftest*
 
fi
 
echo "$ac_t""$ac_cv_have_timespec_struct" 1>&6
if test $ac_cv_have_timespec_struct = yes ; then 
        cat >> confdefs.h <<\EOF
#define HAVE_TIMESPEC_STRUCT 1
EOF
  
fi

    * HP-UX 10.10 and 10.20 (PA-RISC): One reader reports the following
      changes:
      I modified the Make.defines file created by configure:

# System = hppa1.1-hp-hpux10.2
                              
CC = cc                       
# I added -Aa flag (Ansi Mode Compilation) in CFLAGS variable
CFLAGS = -g -D_HPUX_SOURCE -Aa
LIBS = ../libunp.a                         
LIBS_XTI = ../libunpxti.a ../libunp.a -lxti

      To build libgai I had problems with the h_errno variable
      undefined, so I found the definition of this variable in
      /usr/include/netdb.h, the code fragment in netdb.h is:

#ifdef _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED                                 
extern int h_errno;                                           
#endif                                                        

      So I just added the -D_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED directive in CFLAGS
      in Make.defines but this didn't work so I did a dirty modification
      to the libgai/addrinfo.h file, I included the next line at the
      begining of addrinfo.h file:

extern int h_errno;

    * HP-UX B10.20 (9000/700 series): Another reader reports that
      defining _HPUX_SOURCE fixes numerous problems.

    * Linux, RedHat 5.0: Readers have reported problems compiling the
      code in the libgai/ directory: the NI_ constants referenced in the
      file gn_ipv46.c are undefined. The easiest solution is to take the
      definitions of the NI_ constants from the addrinfo.h header and
      put them into the gai_hdr.h header.

    * Linux systems with glibc2.0.6: One reader has reported that Figure
      16.7 (line 22) encounters a problem on these systems. Apparently
      ioctl returns a value of 0 for ifc_len if it encounters an error,
      instead of ioctl returning -1. The easiest solution is to change
      line 12 to initialize lastlen to -1.

      Another problem has been reported with glibc2: the configure
      script assumes that the presence of the addrinfo structure in
      <netdb.h> means that the NI_xxx names are defined in that header,
      which is not the case for these systems. You will need to define
      these constants yourself.

    * Linux systems with kernel 2.0.33: The header poll.h is apparently
      in the /usr/include/sys directory and not the expected
      /usr/include directory for #include <poll.h> that appears in the
      configure script and other headers. The easiest fix is to just
      make a link.

    * Linux, Slackware 3.3. Building the library in /lib generates a
      compiler error for line 102 of the file wrapsock.c complaining
      that the functions prototype for the Poll wrapper function is
      wrong. Installing the pthreads-1.0.tar.gz package solves the problem.

    * NeXTStep 3.3 on an Intel/NeXT platform: The following two fixes
      are needed. (1) Add -posix to the CC flag in the Make.defines
      file. (2) The function strdup is not provided by the standard C
      library so you must provide your own, add it to the lib directory
      and add strdup.o to LIB_OBJS in the Make.defines file.

    * Reliant Unix (used to be called SINIX). Add the following three
      lines to the config.guess file:

RM*:ReliantUNIX-*:*:*) 
echo mips-sni-sysv4 
exit 0 ;; 

      They should be located near the SINIX section and the SINIX
      section should stay in place, as many older systems are still around.

    * SGI IRIX 6.3. I have received the following comments regarding the
      system identified by the configure script as mpis-sgi-irix6.3 on
      an SGI O2:

      The configure script seems to work OK, but it does enable the
      HAVE_MSGHDR_MSG_CONTROL constant in config.h. This causes the code
      in lib/read_fd.c to fail on line 34 of page 387 in UNP. The
      constant SCM_RIGHTS on that line is not known on the SGI
      apparently. I removed the define in config.h and the code compiles
      OK.

      The config.h file correctly attempts to substitute socklen_t with
      unsigned int, but for some reason the compilation in lib doesn't
      actually do the substitution properly, this is probably an SGI
      idiosyncrasy, I have seen many others. I think SGI is probably
      behind in their implementation of Posix.1g. The code compiles with
      warning messages.

      The strangest error is that SGI haven't prototyped the
      pthread_create function properly. In their code and man page, the
      second argument is prototyped as pthread_attr_t *, i.e. without
      the const modifier. I have been chasing around all morning to see
      if I have missed something on this. I have the latest patch
      installed, but no dice. I have opened a case with tech support,
      and will let you know what happens.

      Compiling in intro/ generates many warning errors saying that the
      weak definitions of xdr_* functions in /usr/lib/libnsl.so are
      preempted by weak definitions in /usr/lib/libc.so. So now we know!

    * Solaris 2.6 (and probably other versions, when using Sun's C
      compiler). Although I had early access to Solaris 2.6 for testing,
      this did not include Sun's C compiler, so I had to use gcc. If gcc
      is not being used, the configure script defines __STDC__ which is
probably not correct.
