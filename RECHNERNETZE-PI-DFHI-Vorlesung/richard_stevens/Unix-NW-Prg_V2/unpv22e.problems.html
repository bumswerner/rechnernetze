The following problems have been reported by readers building the source
code. I am just collecting these and making them available: I do not
have access to all the systems to try and duplicate the problems and/or
fix them. Please let me know of any additional problems.

    * Digital Unix 4.0: The configure script does not find the sigwait
      function. The easiest solution is to uncomment the #undef of
      HAVE_SIGWAIT in config.h and change the #undef to #define.

    * HP-UX 10.x/GCC: Run ./configure as instructed in the README file.

      Edit the file unpv22e/lib/unpipc.h and insert #ifdef
      HAVE_PTHREAD_H just before the Pthread_xxxx prototypes, (which
      start on line 427), and put a #endif just after the prototype for
      pr_thread_id. (New line 459.)

      Edit the file unpv22e/lib/my_shm.c and change both occurrences of
      MAP_ANON to MAP_ANONYMOUS.

      Optional: If you have superuser privileges, clean up the include
      header /usr/include/rpc/xdr.h: Remove the extra /* inside the
      commented-out #endif on line 26--this will stop a plethora of
      (harmless) compiler warnings about the embedded comment start token.

      cd to unpv22e/lib and do a make.

      Continue on as described in the README file.

    * AIX 4.3.1: There are three compiler warnings when compiling the
      file /lib/wrapsunrpc.c. These are because the AIX headers do not
      use the const qualifier for the first and last arguments to
      clnt_create.

      Beware of the following comment in the system headers <mqueue.h>
      and <semaphore.h>:

	/* THIS FILE is for conformance to IEEE POSIX 1003.1c.
	 * It describes required symbols for the Realtime option
	 * which is NOT SUPPORTED.
	 */
	

      AIX 4.3.1 does conform to Unix 98, but the Posix realtime options
      are (unfortunately) an option to Unix 98.

    * Linux: The standard Linux releases do not support the Posix.1b
      APIs (Posix message queues, Posix semaphores, and Posix shared
      memory). I just just been made aware of a Posix.1b library
      <http://www.ispras.ru/~knizhnik/> for Linux.

    * Linux, RedHat 5.1: The function prototype for semctl in
      <sys/sem.h> is wrong: the fourth argument is optional (depending
      on the command) and should be specified as ... (an ellipsis). This
      causes an error when compiling the library. The easiest fix is to
      add a dummy argument of 0 to the call to semctl that contains just
      three arguments in lib/wrapunix.c.

      This system also has a <semaphore.h> header, but it doesn't appear
      to fully support Posix semaphores (it appears to support only
      Posix memory-based semaphores). To prevent trying to use Posix
      semaphores, comment out the definition of HAVE_SEMAPHORE_H in the
      config.h header.

    * Solaris 2.6: All my Solaris work was done with GCC, not the Sun C
      compiler. (Anyone at Sun is welcome to send me the Sun compiler.)
      The CFLAGS variable set by the configure script almost certainly
needs to be changed for the Sun compiler.
